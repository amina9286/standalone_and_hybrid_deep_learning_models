# standalone_and_hybrid_deep_learning_models
The base model for all the deep learning model variants are shared here. In this step, the time steps are selected based on correlation. Once the parameters are set up, the models are run with different input variable combination. For the constant lag case, the time steps and input variable combinations are varied simultaneously. 

Here, 
q = upstream gauge discharges
rf = rainfall
temp = temperature
if = inflow
